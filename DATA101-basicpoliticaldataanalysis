#Though the state level option does well to immediately help you pinpoint 
# who took the majority of a state, I think it important to leverage the gradient
# when possible, as it offers a much more contextual perspective on how a greater number of
# individuals participated in our election. Seeing this map paints a much clearer picture
# of how Trump won back then, because seeing a statewide view of where Clinton may have won 
# the majority still didn't accurately describe the sentiments of the non-liberal counties.

# Obama v. Clinton:


clinton_obama_outcomes <- subset(county_votes, select = -c(9, 13,15, 16))%>%
  mutate(obama_prop2 = obama/total_votes_2012)%>%
  mutate(clinton_prop2 = clinton/total_votes_2016)%>% 
  mutate(clinton_success = ifelse(clinton_prop2 > obama_prop2, 'Better', 'Worse'))

# On a map:

  geom_polygon(data=clinton_obama_outcomes, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = clinton_prop2))+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue")+
  coord_quickmap()+
  theme_void()+
  ggtitle("2012 v 2016")+
  labs(fill = "% Clinton > Obama")

# Comparatively speaking, Clinton success was primarily in any state where a major city accounted
# for the majority of the state's population (though one could argue
# things were more polarized in 2016, which cut her campaign off at the knees). Obama (somehow) 
# not only captured the coasts,but had a lot more support the midwest and rockies;
# places where Clinton had a hard time capturing a single county. In all fairness, 
# however, the candidates of the 2012 election were much more 
# moderate overall, and that notion is reflected by the fact that over 2/3 of the 
# states were a shade of purple in 2012.
