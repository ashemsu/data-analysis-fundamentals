# data-fundamentals
These projects encompass my first year of Data Analytics at UPenn. 

Overall, the projects were designed to test several key skills and concepts related to data analysis and visualization. Overall, they covered these key concepts in R:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**
   - **Skill Tested:** Ability to clean and preprocess data for analysis.
   - **Assessment:** Ensuring you can remove irrelevant information, handle missing values, and prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Skill Tested:** Ability to use various visual and statistical techniques to explore data and identify patterns or trends.
   - **Assessment:** Understanding of how to use ggplot2 for different types of visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, bar charts) and interpret the results.

3. **Correlation and Relationship Analysis:**
   - **Skill Tested:** Ability to identify and explain relationships between variables.
   - **Assessment:** Testing whether you can discern and describe how different variables interact, such as the relationship between delays and cancellations, or the impact of engine size on highway mileage.

4. **Data Interpretation and Conclusion Drawing:**
   - **Skill Tested:** Ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data and visualizations.
   - **Assessment:** Ensuring you can interpret the results of your analyses and provide reasoned conclusions about the data.

5. **Practical Application of Statistical Concepts:**
   - **Skill Tested:** Application of statistical principles and data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
   - **Assessment:** Evaluating your understanding of how to apply concepts like averages, proportions, and correlations to practical scenarios.

6. **Visual Communication:**
   - **Skill Tested:** Ability to effectively communicate findings through visualizations.
   - **Assessment:** Ensuring you can create clear, informative charts and graphs that accurately represent the data and support your conclusions.

Overall, the projects likely aimed to test your proficiency in data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and interpretation, ensuring you can effectively analyze and communicate insights from data.
