#Problem 1

#Getting the data:

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)

trump_approve <- read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_topline.csv")

# Plotting the aggregate approval:

aggregate_estimates <- trump_approve%>% # For easier viz into comparison
  select(approve_estimate, disapprove_estimate, modeldate, subgroup)%>%
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate))

ggplot(aggregate_estimates)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(approve_estimate, modeldate, color = subgroup), alpha = .5)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_dark()+
  xlab("Estimated Rating")+
  ylab("Year")
  

#A

# Trump's approval rating in early 2020 (Feb-March of 2020 specifically) reached
# a near-all time high (since 2017) on the heels of his response to the onslaught of 
# COVID-19 and how the US, for a brief moment, was united behind our leadership
# to shepherd us through those uncertain, scary times.


# Problem 2

# Getting NYCFlights and drilling down to relevant data

library(nycflights13)
view(flights)

aggregate_flight_times <- flights%>% # For better viz
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute, dep_delay)

formatted_flight_times <- aggregate_flight_times%>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))

ggplot(formatted_flight_times)+
  geom_point(aes(day, dep_delay, color = dep_delay))+
  theme_gray()+
  xlab("Day of the Month")+
  ylab("Departure Delay")
  
# Based on the data in this graph, there are more delays (and longer delays) 
# earlier in a typical week.

# Problem 3

# How does the average delay time change over the course of a day? 
# Should you use dep_time or sched_dep_time? Why?

# Finding hourly data:

ggplot(formatted_flight_times)+
  geom_point(aes(hour, dep_delay, color = dep_delay))+
  theme_gray()+
  xlab("Hour of the Day")+
  ylab("Departure Delay")

# According to this graph, the average delay time gets longer between mid-afternoon
# and early evening (4:00 PM - 8:00 PM). If I wanted accurate data, I would be
# choosing the actual dep_time over sched_dep_time, as the sched_dep_time can
# help determine averages, but won't reflect the times when flights don't leave at
# or before the scheduled time.

# Problem 4

# New dataset for cancelled flights

cancellations <- flights%>%
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute, dep_time, arr_time)%>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))%>%
  mutate(cancelled = is.na(arr_time))%>%
  mutate(intervals = minutes(15)) %>%
  group_by(intervals)

# Plotting cancellations down to a per minute/hour basis

cancellations%>%
  filter(hour >= 5)%>%
ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(minute, hour, color = cancelled))+
  theme_dark()+
  xlab("Minute of the Hour")+
  ylab("Hour of the Day")

# According to the plot, your flight is most likely to be cancelled in the middle of the day,
# sometime between the 15 and 40 minute intervals of a given hour.

# Problem 5

# Getting the data

# COVID-19 had the most prevalent impact on the price of the share prices, as
# early 2020 (Feb/March) caused a catastrophic dip in Apple's market cap, and dinged 
# Microsoft pretty hard as well.

#B

# Analyzing energy stocks

energy_prices <- tq_get(c('UCO', 'SCO'),

# Plotting trends

ggplot(energy_prices)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(date, adjusted, color = symbol), alpha = .5)+
  theme_dark()+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Share Price")

# I chose this specifically because I followed energy stocks during this time frame (and still do).
# These stocks are specifically interesting because they aren't associated with companies,
# but rather are each depending on price action with regard to oil futures--more specifically,
# WTI crude oil futures, which went through a deeply tumultuous period between early 2020
# and now, as there were geopolitical, supply chain, and economic impacts on the contracts are the time.
# SCO is the short against UCO, and though the share price wasn't exactly the same,
# you will notice the synergistic relationship between the two; when one increases, the other decreases.
# There is a lot more stability now, but if you ever wanted visibility into one factor determining the price
# of fuel, look no further than these tickers.
