# 1. Solve problem 13.5.1.5 from R for Data Science.
# 13.5.1.5
# What does anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) tell you? 
# What does anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) tell you?

# The first line tells me that the data set won't display
# the rows from "airports" that matches "flights".

# The second line is the same, except that it would be in reverse, where the rows
# from "airports" that don't have a match in flights would be displayed.

#2. Find the day during 2013 that had the longest avg total delay. Using the 
# weather data, can you shed any light on what happened on that day?

nycflights13::flights

# To find day with the longest delay:
longest_delays <- flights%>%
  filter(arr_delay>0, dep_delay >0)%>%
  group_by(flight, day, month, arr_delay, dep_delay)%>%
  summarise(lngst_avg_delay = mean(arr_delay + dep_delay))%>%
  arrange(desc(lngst_avg_delay))

# Incorporating the impact of weather on that day:
longest_delays%>%
  left_join(weather)

# Based on the weather data, the longest delays (which appear to be rescheduled flights)
# occurred as a result of inclement weather--specifically, bad winter weather.

#3.Find airplane models with fastest avg speeds. What planes are they?

# Finding fastest planes:
fastest_planes <- planes%>%
  filter(speed>400)%>%
  group_by(model, type, speed, tailnum, seats)%>%
  arrange(desc(speed))

# Determining which models are fastest:
fastest_planes%>%
  left_join(flights, c("tailnum" = "tailnum"))%>%
  count(model, tailnum, seats, sort=T) %>%
  head(10)

# The DC-9-51, a medium-sized airplane appears to be the fastest, which isn't 
# surprised given the fact that it is lighter than the larger planes, but has more powerful
# engines than the smaller ones.

# 4. Solve 13.4.6.3 from R for Data Science.
# 13.4.6.3.
# Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

# To analyze age v. delays:
plane_age <- planes%>%
  group_by(year, tailnum)%>%
  summarise(plane_age = mean(2021 - year))

flight_delay <-flights%>%
  group_by(arr_delay, day, month, tailnum)%>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay))%>%
  arrange(desc(avg_delay))

# Visualizing relationship:
plane_age%>%
  left_join(flight_delay, c("tailnum" = "tailnum"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(plane_age, avg_delay, color = year))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()

# The relationship at face value appears to be the older a plane is, the lesser
# the delay. I would surmise this is because the newer planes are more frequently used,
# which also means they're more commonly delayed for things like weather and maintenance.
